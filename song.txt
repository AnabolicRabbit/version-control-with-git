Beyond the horizon of the place
We lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly
And without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had began.

Along the Long Road and
On down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut?

There was a ragged band
That followed in our footsteps
Running before time
Took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures
Trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay.

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder
