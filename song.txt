Beyond the horizon of the place
We lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly
And without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had began.

Along the Long Road and
On down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut?

There was a ragged band
That followed in our footsteps
Running before time
Took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures
Trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay.

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers
Of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green
It was on the other side
Steps taken forwards
But sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed up world.

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied;
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road
We've been so many times.

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded.

The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever...
